# Refactoring

1. What is refactoring?

    1. Making a series of tiny changes
    2. Preserving observable behaviour

2. Why we should be refactoring?

    1. Cost of maintenance
    2. Necessary for TDD
    3. Necessary for Domain Driven Design
    4. Necessary for Working effectively with legacy code
    5. Necessary for any Agile methodology

3. When should we refactor?

    1. Code Smell - e.g. Large Class
    2. Design Principle - e.g. Separation of Concerns

4. Steps for refactoring

    1. Extract Class

        1. Move field
        2. Move method

5. Tests - How many times, how often?

    1. Compile and test after each tiny step
    2. Keep the tests green

6. Notice that

    1. Bigger refactorings involve smaller refactorings
    2. We are making a series of small safe steps

7. Helpful but not necessary

    1. Automated Refactorings from IDE
