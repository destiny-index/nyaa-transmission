Refactoring
===========

1. What is refactoring?

    1. Making a series of tiny changes
    2. Preserving observable behaviour
    3. Simple Example - Self encapsulate field

2. Why we should be refactoring?

    1. Cost of maintenance
    2. Easier to add new features
    3. Technical Empathy
    4. Necessary for any Agile methodology
    5. Necessary for TDD
    6. Necessary for Working effectively with legacy code

3. When should we refactor?

    1. Code Smell - e.g. Large Class
    2. Design Principle - SRP

4. Steps for refactoring

    1. Extract Class

        1. Move field
        2. Move method

5. Tests - How many times, how often?

    1. Compile and test after each tiny step
    2. Keep the tests green

6. Notice that

    1. Bigger refactorings involve smaller refactorings
    2. We are making a series of small safe steps

7. Helpful

    1. Automated Refactorings from IDE
    2. Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code
